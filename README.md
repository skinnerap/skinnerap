- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an online ordering system for a regional chain restaurant. This project utilizes React on the front-end and features a secure authentication system. I am using Firebase for authetication, as well as a cloud storage bucket to serve as the core database. I am using Chipotle's "Meal System" as an inspiration for this project, allowing customers to easily reorder and customize their favorite meals. This leads to a superior user experience, as this and security are my primary priorities on this project. I am also focusing on delivering a beautiful and responsive user interface.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning regular expressions (RegEx) in an effort to add new validation and security skills to my toolbelt of knowledge. I am also focusing the majority of my daily study time to security best practices. I am always furthering my expertise as much as possible in the following languages/frameworks: React, Angular, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Firebase, and SQL databases.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any web application project that utilizes a team environment and git best practices. My goal is to gain as much experience as possible in enterprise and enterprise-like environments!

- âš¡ Fun fact: Once upon a time I was a nationally top ranked Tae Kwon Do competitor. These days I prefer to compete in a coding contest!
